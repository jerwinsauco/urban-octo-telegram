#urban-octo-telegram

This is my first Weekly Challenge submission for this bootcamp program. As well, this is very first readme.md file. 

This readme is my learning reflection on the process of completing this challenge - urban-octo-telegram.

Module 1 of the bootcamp discusses HTML and CSS. Completing this challenge helped me reinforce my learning on the importance of semantic HTML element, debugging an existing code, and optimizing existing code as per requirement of the assigment. 

The use of Semantic HTML element provides many advantages. One advantages is providing developers an easy to follow outline of the content. It shows the parent item to its child. It also shows the code in a systematic way. For example, on this assignment the main section has three different articles; the Aside section has three different sections. The use of semantic helps divide the code content by area of focus. This makes it so much easier to change or add style on css. 

Also, examining an existing code carefully throughout this challenge has help me apply familiarity to syntax. This help developer determine area that needed to be change or imporoved such as in this activity. The navigation function on this activity initially doest not direct user to its respective section of the webpag. I was able to determine that this is not working and that it need to be debugged. I then addressed the issue and able to apply correct HTML selector for it to work. 

Lastly, I have learned that developers needed to be cognizant of webpage accessibility and search engine optimization. And this is acheived through proper implementation of semantic HTML element. I was able to differentiate decorative images and functional images in the webpage. I applied alternative description of the image for functional images, whereas blank or null alternative for decorative images. This allows screenreader to skip over an image that does not have any function to the webpage. 

As I gain more and more practice and experience in web development, I now understand the importance of arrange your code in a way that is easy to follow and not confusing to the reader. I have also learned that commenting throughout your project helps me or future developers on troubleshooting or improving the webpage.
